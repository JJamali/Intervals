# Intervals
A Django/React webapp that trains the user to identify musical intervals in a progressive, quiz based system. 
Users can create accounts to save their progress.

Uses Django REST framework and a PostgreSQL database.
Automated tests can be found in the tests folder.
App is containerized with NGINX and Docker. 

A secret .env file (not shown on github) is used to conceal sensitive information such as the Django secret key and database information.

Currently the quiz interface looks like this:

Our next steps are implementing a cleaner UI:
